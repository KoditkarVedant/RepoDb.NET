I had published an article in Medium titled "Why choose RepoDb ORM over Dapper". Though the title seems to be identical on the [article](https://dev.to/mikependon/c-what-will-make-you-choose-repodb-over-dapper-orm-3eb8) that I posted in DEV.to, but the content is completely different.

In this article, you will see and understand the high-level perspective of the differences between RepoDb and Dapper, not the 1-to-1 comparisson like the one in DEV.to. After reading this article, you will most likely understand the concepts and why RepoDb is there. Enjoy reading the article!

You can see the article from this [link](https://medium.com/dev-genius/why-choose-repodb-orm-over-dapper-da87432c7830?source=friends_link&sk=741afa3a7673827d0eef4ee6942998ce). Or copy + paste the link below into your browser.
