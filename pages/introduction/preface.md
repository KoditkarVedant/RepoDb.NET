# Preface

[RepoDb](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb) is an open-source .NET ORM library that bridges the gap of micro-ORMs and macro-ORMs (aka Full-ORMs). It helps the developers to simplify the switch-over of when to use the BASIC and ADVANCE operations during the application development.

You can use the library to work with [SQL Server](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqlServer), [SQLite](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.SqLite), [MySQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.MySql) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.nuget.org/packages/RepoDb.PostgreSql) Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS).

It is here to improve the things and experiences when working with the Data Access Technology in .NET space.

We are glad and thankful to your interest in learning RepoDb. We hope that you will learn a lot and improve your development experiences while using this library.
